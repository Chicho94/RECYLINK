Backend
	Get: fetch all items from the database and return them
	Create: create a new item, save it to the database and return it

Frontend
	Single view application
	Allows the user to view all items in the database (through a table or similar)
	Allows the user to create a new item and see the list of items updated after inserting it

Example
	The chosen item are animals at the zoo, so the user may view all animals (including some specific data), input any new animals that have arrived and delete the record of any chosen animal.

Requirements
	Must be built using the MERN stack
	All frontend styles are up to you, show us your creativity!
	Both apps must be documented with a README file
	All libraries and packages (besides the MERN stack) are up to you

Extra Points
	The following are NOT required, but may give you an advantage, so they are highly encouraged:

	Use of React Hooks
	Any loading method (Suspense, loading state through Hooks, etc.)
	Animations
	End-to-end backend testing (with Jest)
	Use GraphQL instead of REST
	Allow update of items
	Allow deletion for items for api and client
	Add pagination to the list
	Have responsive design
